# The account that Jently will use for communicating with GitHub.
# You can either use standard login credentials, or you can
# specify a GitHub oauth token. If you choose to use an oauth token,
# make sure to comment out or delete the github_password from this file.
# Note that this config file supports ERB. This allows you to store
# sensitive information as shell environment variables which can then
# be referred to in this file.
# For example, if you were to store your GitHub login as the GITHUB_LOGIN
# environment variable, then you could specify your GitHub login like this:
# :github_login: <%= ENV['GITHUB_LOGIN'] %>
:github_login: github_login
:github_password: github_password
#:github_oauth_token: github_oauth_token

# To use Jently with GitHub Enterprise, you'll need to set the GitHub
# API and web endpoints. Otherwise, leave these lines commented out.
#:github_api_endpoint: github_api_endpoint
#:github_web_endpoint: github_web_endpoint

# The repository that contains the pull requests you want to run tests on.
# For example, if you wanted to test the pull requests of the Jently repository,
# you would put git@github.com:vaneyckt/Jently.git here.

# as timed out. A good number for this is twice the amount of time that the test job

# By default, Jently tests all pull requests.  If you only want Jently to test pull requests that
# are to be merged into specific branches, uncomment the following, and specify these branches, one per line.
