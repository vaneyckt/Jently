# The account that Jently will use for communicating with GitHub.
# Note that this config file supports ERB. This allows you to store
# sensitive information as shell environment variables which can then
# be referred to in this file.
# For example, if you were to store your github login as the GITHUB_LOGIN
# environment variable, then you could specify your github login like this:
# :github_login: <%= ENV['GITHUB_LOGIN'] %>
:github_login: github_login
:github_password: github_password

# The repository that contains the pull requests you want to run tests on.
# For example, if you wanted to test the pull requests of the Jently repository,
# you would put git@github.com:vaneyckt/Jently.git here.
:github_ssh_repository: git@github.com:vaneyckt/Jently.git

# The interval between successive communications with GitHub.
# This makes sure we don't end up spamming GitHub's servers.

# If access to your Jenkins CI is restricted with a login and password,
# you can enther these here. Otherwise you should delete these lines.
:jenkins_login: jenkins_login
:jenkins_password: jenkins_password

# The url that your Jenkins CI can be found at.
:jenkins_url: jenkins_url

# The Jenkins build job for testing that you set up in step 1 of the installation
# guide at https://github.com/vaneyckt/Jently/blob/master/README.rdoc.
:jenkins_job_name: test_job

# The amount of time Jently will wait for a test job to complete before marking it
# as timed out. A good number for this is twice the amount of time that the test job
# should take on average.
:jenkins_job_timeout_seconds: 1800

# The interval between successive polling requests that Jently makes to Jenkins in
# order to query the state of the test job.
:jenkins_polling_interval_seconds: 60

# When Jently needs to test a pull request, it creates a special testing branch.
# Here you can specify the name of this branch. You'll want to give it a name that
# people are unlikely to use for their feature branches.
